# AI Doctor 🚑💡

AI Doctor is an AI-driven healthcare solution that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to assist medical professionals in diagnosing and recommending treatments for various conditions. The platform uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process patient data and provide real-time diagnostic suggestions. Built on Streamlit for an intuitive user interface, the app is easily accessible for healthcare professionals. The use of Vultr’s cloud services ensures scalable, secure, and high-performance operations. This project aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce patient wait times, and enhance overall healthcare delivery. 🌍🩺

## Problem Statement 🚨
In today's society, many people lack awareness of diseases and their associated symptoms, leading to late diagnoses and complications. Often, individuals do not seek medical attention until their condition worsens due to a lack of knowledge about the potential seriousness of their symptoms. This lack of awareness can result in delayed treatment and poor health outcomes. AI Doctor aims to address this issue by providing a platform that educates users about possible diseases based on their symptoms. By delivering real-time, AI-driven diagnostic suggestions, the project helps spread awareness and encourages early detection, empowering individuals to take proactive steps toward their health and well-being. 💪🧠

## Proposed Solution 💡
AI Doctor is designed to assist healthcare professionals by offering AI-based diagnostic tools. Key features include: 
- **Real-Time Diagnosis**: Utilizing ANN and CNN models to analyze medical images and patient records for real-time diagnostic suggestions. 🖼️🔍
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A Streamlit-based web application to make it simple for anyone to input patient data and retrieve diagnoses. 💻📱
- **Scalability**: Deployed on Vultr Kubernetes Engine (VKE) to handle large-scale data and ensure availability during high demand. 📈⚙️
- **Secure Data Handling**: Vultr Block Storage is used to securely store medical records, ensuring data compliance. 🔒💾
